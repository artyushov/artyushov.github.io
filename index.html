        Hi, my name is Nikita. I'm a software engineer at <strong><a href="http://plumbr.eu">Plumbr</a></strong>. I'm initially from St.
        Petersburg, Russia, but currently working and living in Tartu, Estonia. My primary specialisation is Java, but I
        feel comfortable with many other technologies and paradigms (except Angular.js, it freaks me out).
    </p>
    <p>
        Work is an essential part of my life and I’m happy to be one of those people who truly enjoy it. I’m strongly
        motivated by challenging problems like finding the causes of some bizarre bugs or performance bottlenecks as
        well as writing quality code with good architecture. I enjoy the moments when the mere knowledge of a
        programming language isn't enough and you need to go deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides that, I dance lindy-hop and do other kinds of sports such as: volleyball, football, basketball,
        whateverball, table tennis, etc.
